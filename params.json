{"name":"CN24","tagline":"Convolutional (Patch) Networks for Semantic Segmentation","body":"## Welcome to CN24!\r\n\r\nCN24 is a complete semantic segmentation framework using fully convolutional networks. It supports a wide variety of\r\nplatforms (Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) and libraries (OpenCL, Intel MKL, AMD ACML...) while providing dependency-free\r\nreference implementations. The software is developed in the [Computer Vision Group](http://www.inf-cv.uni-jena.de) at the [University of Jena](http://www.uni-jena.de).\r\n\r\n## Why should I use CN24?\r\n1. Designed for *pixel-wise labeling and semantic segmentation* (train and test your own networks!)\r\n2. Suited for *various applications* in [driver assistance systems](http://hera.inf-cv.uni-jena.de:6680/pdf/Brust15:CPN.pdf), scene understanding, remote sensing, biomedical image processing and many more\r\n3. *OpenCL support* not only suited for NVIDIA GPUs\r\n4. High-performance implementation with *minimal dependencies* to other libraries\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nTo get started, clone this repository and visit the [wiki](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki)! Installation is just a two command lines away. For an even faster introduction, check out one of these examples:\r\n\r\n* [Urban Scene Understanding Example](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki/Urban-Scene-Understanding-Example)\r\n* [Road Detection Example](https://github.com/cvjena/cn24/wiki/Road-Detection-Example)\r\n\r\nThe repository contained pre-trained networks for these two applications, which are ready to use.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\nCN24 is available under a 3-clause BSD license.
